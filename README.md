# Product Documentation Strategy Presentation

This repository contains a technical presentation created using [Marp](https://marp.app/), demonstrating a "Docs as Code" approach to product documentation. It serves as both a strategic guide for documentation teams and a technical showcase of Marp's capabilities.

## Overview

The presentation outlines strategies for modernizing documentation workflows, emphasizing:
- **Version Control**: Managing documentation with Git to enable collaboration.
- **Portability**: Using Markdown as a single source of truth for HTML, PDF, and Slide outputs.
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture ensuring scalability and easy updates.

## Technical Features Demonstrated

This project showcases several advanced Marp and Markdown features customized for technical presentations:

* **Custom Theming**: A bespoke "TechDoc" theme using CSS variables for consistent typography (Inter/Fira Code) and color palettes.
* **Algorithmic Notation**: Mathematical equations rendering for time complexity analysis ($O(n log n)$).
* **Visual Layouts**: usage of grid layouts, tiled content, and full-bleed background images for architectural diagrams.
* **Marp Directives**: Implementation of page numbering, pagination, and header/footer customization.
